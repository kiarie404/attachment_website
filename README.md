# attachment_website
The sole purpose of this application is to make CSC 331 more smooth on both lecturers and students.\
but mostly the students. 😅.

It does this by:
1. Reducing paperwork. (for students and lecturers)
   - automatic papers. (submission and storage)
   - journaling through mdbooks instead of log book

2. Increasing integrity checks. (for lecturers)
   - date integrity via github upload records.
   - signature integrity

   
3. Ideas on where/how to get attachment?🤷🏾
