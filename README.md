The sole purpose of this guide is to make CSC 331 more smooth on both lecturers and students.\
but mostly the students. ðŸ˜….\
It is a work in progress. Open to any kind of contribution.

Its intended users are :
1. CSC 331 students.
2. Lecturers.
3. Industrial supervisors.


#### Functionalities
1. Students can create and edit an e-logbook. No more physical logbooks. No more printing. No more scanning and stamping.
2. Lecturers can view the e-logbook of any student at their own convenience. (e-logbook can be accessed online)
3. The industrial supervisor can view the logbook, make comments and approve logbook.

#### Benefits
1. Reducing paperwork. Paperwork is such a drag.(for students and lecturers)
2. Increasing integrity checks. (for lecturers)

##### Why paperwork is not OK
1. Papers are not the best things to use when writing content that needs frequent editing. Editing papers means you have to re-print and re-scan documents.
2. Papers are not portable. An online e-book is more portable.
3. Papers do not provide an interactive environment for the reader. For example: you can't include links, themes or interactive menus. 

Here is an example of an [e-logbook](https://kiarie404.github.io/Attachment_journal/)
