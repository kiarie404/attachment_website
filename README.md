2. Lecturers.
3. Industrial supervisors.


#### Functionalities
1. Students can create and edit an e-logbook. No more physical logbooks.
2. Lecturers can view the e-logbook of any student at their own convenience. (e-logbook can be accessed online)
3. The industrial supervisor can view the logbook, make comments and approve logbook.

#### Benefits
1. Reducing paperwork. (for students and lecturers)
2. Increasing integrity checks. (for lecturers)

##### Why paperwork is not OK
1. Papers are not the best things to use when writing content that needs frequent editing. Editing means you have to re-print and re-scan a document.
2. Papers are not portable. An online e-book is more portable.
3. Papers do not provide an interactive environment for the reader. For example: you can't include links, themes or interactive menus.
